# Day 1
Here you can find the material corresponding to day 1 of TEQS. Lecture notes contain more content that what was covered during the actual lecture. This is to give you some additional context on the origin of quantum mechanics and quantum information. If you just want to review the content from lecture 1, refer to section 2. Don't be frightened by the content in other sections, this will be covered more in depth in coming lectures. 

Problem set 1 contains contains two sections: **Exercises** and **Bonus**. The problems in the first section will be graded over 100 and the bonus problem will be counted as extra credit if you solve it. (And a $100,000 reward to anyone that solves part (b) of the bonus problem.) Solve these exercises on paper (or anything you can submit as a PDF or image file) and submit them in the form we're going to share in the Discord server. Feel free to make any questions about the problems in `#q-n-a` or reach out to mentors!

Slides as annotated during the lecture are given. As well as the slides without any annotations, so you can review the concepts and do the exercises done by the lecturer by yourself.
