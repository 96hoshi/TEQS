# Prerequisites
To make sure everyone that attends TEQS has the required background, we put together three notebooks that go over everything you need to know before starting the course. Don't worry if some of the content on these notebooks doesn't make complete sense to you, the topics will also be covered in lectures where we will show more examples amd work through exercises. 

The following topics are covered:
 - [Chapter 1](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS/blob/main/Pre-requisites/Chapter%201%20-%20Math%20Tools%20I%20(Vectors%2C%20Complex%20Numbers%20and%20Dirac%20Notation).ipynb) is on vectors and how they are used to represent the state of a qubit
 - [Chapter 2](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS/blob/main/Pre-requisites/Chapter%202%20-%20Math%20Tools%20II%20(Linear%20Operators).ipynb) is on operators and how they are used to manipulate the state of a qubit
 - [Chapter 3](https://github.com/The-Eigensolvers/TEQS/blob/main/Pre-requisites/Chapter%203%20-%20Classical%20Computation%20and%20Logic.ipynb) is on Classical Information and Boolean Logic

If you have any questions about the content in the notebooks, make sure to reach out to mentors in the Discord server. They will be happy to help you go over any concept you may find difficult. 

**Note:** because GitHub has some issues rendering the equations we have included in these notebooks (mainly the second one), we advise that you clone/download this repository and run the files locally or in the [IBM Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab). This way, you will see the equations as intended; and you will be able to play around with the code we wrote in the notebooks.
